Auxia is a machine learning-based growth platform that helps product teams rapidly launch and scale key in-product growth features.

# How it works
Auxia leverages proprietary machine learning algorithms to deliver a substantial improvement in how companies activate, engage, and retain their users.

After connecting your data sources, Auxia enables product teams to rapidly set up a series of ‘growth treatments’ (e.g. in-app prompts, incentives, etc) with no engineering effort.

Then, our proprietary machine learning algorithms predict, select, and deploy the optimal growth treatment - the optimal sequence, message, channel, surface, incentive, and timing - for the right user, at a very personalized level. Over time, these algorithms automatically optimize each individual user's experience based on their behavior and characteristics, identifying the ideal growth journey to drive our customers growth outcomes (e.g. free-to-paid conversion, 30-day retention, etc)

# Getting started

To get started with Auxia, there is a simple, 3-step process. The following documentation pages focus on this third step -- integrating Auxia's APIs into your application.

Auxia platform is extremely flexible and customizable to each of our respective customer's needs.

After integrating our APIs, our customers have total control over how the format of the content appears to their users. In the "Templates" section, we provide an example to demonstrate the simplicity of a typical client-side implementation to render a treatment in your product.
